# api-engineering-agent-skills

Production-grade [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) for designing and reviewing REST APIs. Each skill packages opinionated guidance, real worked examples, and review checklists grounded in current IETF standards (RFC 9110, 9457, draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header-07).

These skills are written to the open Agent Skills standard and work with any compatible runtime — Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Goose, and others. The format is the same across all of them.

## What's in here

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| [`api-idempotency`](./api-idempotency/) | Apply idempotency patterns when designing or reviewing REST endpoints, webhooks, and any operation with side effects. Covers Idempotency-Key headers, natural-key dedupe, storage schemas, concurrency handling, and a 16-item anti-pattern catalog. |
| [`api-error-responses`](./api-error-responses/) | Design HTTP error responses across the four major formats (RFC 9457 Problem Details, JSON:API, `google.rpc.Status`, custom). Covers status code selection, validation errors, security, and OpenAPI integration. |

More skills will be added over time. Each is self-contained — install only the ones you need.

## Installing into Claude

Two ways:

**Option 1 — pre-built `.skill` files (easiest).** Grab the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page, download the `.skill` file for the skill you want, and upload it via Claude.ai → Settings → Capabilities → Skills.

**Option 2 — build from source.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/api-engineering-agent-skills.git
cd api-engineering-agent-skills
python scripts/build.py
# .skill files are now in dist/
```

Then upload the `.skill` files from `dist/` via the same Claude.ai settings page.

## Installing into other runtimes

Each runtime has its own install path; the source folder is the same.

- **Claude Code** — drop the skill folder into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory or `~/.claude/skills/` for global use. See [Claude Code Skills docs](https://docs.claude.com).
- **Codex CLI** — see [OpenAI's Codex CLI documentation](https://github.com/openai/codex-cli) for the current install path.
- **Cursor, Gemini CLI, Goose, etc.** — most read skills from a configured directory; consult each runtime's docs.

The `SKILL.md` format and folder structure are identical across runtimes per the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/).

## Development

```bash
# Validate all skills (run before committing)
python scripts/validate.py

# Build all skills into dist/*.skill
python scripts/build.py

# Build just one
python scripts/build.py api-idempotency
```

Validation runs automatically on every push and pull request via GitHub Actions.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. A new skill should:

1. Live in its own top-level folder named exactly the same as the `name:` field in its `SKILL.md` frontmatter.
2. Have a description in the frontmatter that's specific enough to trigger reliably (~50+ characters, includes both what it does and when to use it).
3. Pass `python scripts/validate.py`.
4. Cite primary sources (RFCs, official docs) rather than blog posts where possible.
5. Include a "Sources" section at the bottom of `SKILL.md` and any reference files.

The [`skill-creator` skill](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skill-creator) (in Anthropic's official skills repo) is useful for drafting and iterating on new skills.
